My current project. Webpage is not styled what-so-ever, but the backend it working the way I'd like. Users can signin with an existing Facebook account (Omniauth), or they can create a new account to use (Devise). 

Once logged in they can send friend requests to other users, see the posts of all of their friends on a "timeline", make posts, comment on posts, and edit their account.

The next step is to stylize my content, starting with the user's profile page.
